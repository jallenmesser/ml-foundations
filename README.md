# ML Foundations

This repository documents my return to core machine learning
and mathematical foundations as I prepare for AI-focused roles.

My goal is not speed or memorization, but deep understanding
through intuition, implementation, and explanation.

Topics I will cover include:
- Gradients and optimization
- Vectors and matrices
- Probability and expectation
- What it means for a model to learn

This repository will evolve as I learn.
